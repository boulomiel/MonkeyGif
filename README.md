- swift-async-algorithms -  Locally, updated ios version so it supports arm64 (previews and simulator usage)

## How to use

- The toggle button at the top leading defines what search should we achieve (global words or ids) 
- If the search returns no result, we can refresh the collection by scrolling down and fetch trending GIFS

- The star button at the top trailing open the favorites saved
- To add a favorite, long press on it and on the context menu select add favorite
